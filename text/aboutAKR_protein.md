**Loop Structure.** Using the structure of AKR1C9W, CHO Reductase with NADP+, three large loops can
be assigned.

**Cofactor Binding Site.** Cofactor binding site for 3α-HSD (AKR1C9); taken from
PDB 1LWI. Distances are in angstroms.

**Typical Catalytic Tetrad.** Blue sphere indicates the position of a water
molecule and the probable position of the substrate carbonyl. Taken from 3α-HSD
(AKR1c9). See PDB 1LW1.
