### Protein Structures

AKRs are characterized by an (αβ)8-barrel structure:

**Loop Structure.** Using the secondary structure of rat liver 3α-HSD (AKR1c9)
as a template the positions of β-sheets, α-helices and the three large loops can
be assigned.

- B1 (7-9), B2 (15-17), H1 (239-248) and H2 (290-298) are β-sheets and
  α-helices, respectively not in the core of the (α/β) 8-barrel structure.
- Positions of α-helices are α1 (32-43), α2 (58-70), α3 (95-106), α4 (144-156),
  α5 (170-177), α6 (200-209), α7 (252-262), and α8 (274-280).
- Positions of β-strands in the barrel are: β1 (20-22), β2 (48-50), β3 (80-85),
  β4 (111-116), β5 (160-166), β6 (188-192), β7 (212-216), and β8 (265-269).
- Loop A is located from 117-143, Loop B is located at 217-238 and loop C is
  located from 299-322.
- Residues involved in cofactor biding are: T (24), D (50), S (166), N (167), Q
  (190), Y (216), S (221), R (270), S (271), R (276), E (279), and N (280).
- Residues involved in substrate binding are: T (24), L (54), F (118), F (129),
  T (226), W (227), N (306), and Y (310).
- Residues involved in catalysis are: D (50), Y (55), K (84) and H (117).
- All residues are numbered relative to 3α-HSD structure.
