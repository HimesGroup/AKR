### Nomenclature

The general format for AKR names is as follows: the root symbol 'AKR' for
Aldo-Keto Reductase; an Arabic number designating the family; a letter
indicating the subfamily when multiple subfamilies exist; and an Arabic numeral
representing the unique protein sequence. Under the system, the protein AKR1A1
would be the first AKR in family 1, subfamily A, and in this instance
corresponds to human aldehyde reductase.

**Definition of Families.** Delineation of families occurs at the 40% amino acid
identity level. Members of an AKR family should have < 40% amino acid identity
with any other family. At present, the fourteen families defined by our cluster
analysis satisfy this criterion.

**Definition of Subfamilies.** Within a given family, subfamilies may be defined
by a > 60% identity in amino acid sequence among subfamily members. By this
definition, nine of fourteen AKR families include multiple subfamilies. For
example, family AKR1 includes the following subfamilies: A) mammalian aldehyde
reductases; B) mammalian aldose reductases; C) hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases
(HSDs); and D) Δ4-3-ketosteroid-5β-reductase. Numbering of the known members of
each subfamily was assigned in an arbitrary fashion. For example, AKR1A1,
AKR1A2, and AKR1A3 are the aldehyde reductases from human, pig, and rat,
respectively. Any new additions to a subfamily are numbered chronologically.

**Allelic Variants versus Isoforms.** Allelic variation may occur between
superfamily members. We propose that proteins with > 97% amino acid sequence
identity are alleles of the same gene unless: they have different enzyme
activities; they are encoded by different cDNA's, usually evident by a distinct
3'-untranslated region (UTR); and they are derived from genes of different
structure. While AKR1C1 [human dihydrodiol dehydrogenases 1 (DD1)], and AKR1C2
[human dihydrodiol dehydrogenases 2 (DD2)] are 98% identical in amino acid
sequence and have 3'-UTRs which are 97% identical, the substrate specificity and
function of these proteins are quite different. AKR1C1 is predominantly a
20α-HSD while AKR1C2 is the major bile acid binding protein in human liver.
Based on these functional differences, we have assigned AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 as
unique members of the AKR superfamily.

**Dimeric Proteins.** Currently, the AKR2, AKR6, and AKR7 families have been shown to
form multimers. To expand the nomenclature to accommodate multimers we recommend
that the composition and stoichiometry be listed. For example, AKR7A1:AKR7A4
(1:3) would designate a tetramer of the composition indicated.

**AKR Genes.** The designation for an AKR superfamily gene should be noted in
italics to distinguish between the gene and the protein. For example, the gene
*AKR1A1* encodes the protein AKR1A1.

The above nomenclature system was adopted at the 8th International Workshop on
the Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. It is similar to
that for the cytochrome P450 superfamily, but, unlike that system, amino acid
sequences are used for comparisons. For historical reasons, the AKR1A subfamily
represents the aldehyde reductases and the AKR1B subfamily represents the aldose
reductase. We recommend that authors referencing members of the AKR superfamily
use any previous names along with the new designation in parenthesis - for
example, human aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1).
