1. Since the proposed nomenclature system is protein-based, the newly identified
   AKR will require that the amino acid sequence has been obtained by either
   cDNA cloning or by direct methods. The protein encoded by a cDNA should have
   been either overexpressed or purified from its natural source. Investigators
   should provide [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/),
   [Swiss-Prot](https://www.expasy.org/resources/uniprotkb-swiss-prot) or PIR accession
   numbers.

2. Upon submission of a complete protein sequence, it will be matched against
   the AKRs in the database and placed within the cluster analysis. When
   submitting sequences investigator should provide the following information:
   <ul>
       <li> Trivial name if one has been assigned </li>
        <li> Species of origin </li>
        <li> Expression system used </li>
        <li> Substrate used to assign enzyme activity </li>
        <li> Accession number </li>
        <li> Status of publication </li>
        <li> Citation if exists </li>
        <li> Complete contact information for the submitter </li>
        &nbsp;
    </ul>

3. The location of the sequence within the superfamily cluster analysis will
   determine its assigned designation. As needed, new families and subfamilies
   will be added to the existing system.

4. The sequence, the assigned designation, and position within the cluster
   analysis will be returned to the submitter, but the database will not be
   updated until the submission has been published. We encourage the submitter
   to use the new assignment in their publication. It is an investigator's
   responsibility to notify the web-site that the information submitted has been
   published and provide the appropriate citation.
