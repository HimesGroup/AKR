### Aldo-Keto Reductase (AKR) Superfamily Database

This site contains existing and potential protein sequences of the AKR protein
superfamily, as well as tools to visualize aligned sequences and their
conservation across species. In addition, scientists are encouraged to submit
newly identified AKRs.

AKRs share similar three-dimensional structures involving a parallel
β-8/α-8-barrel fold, and they function as enzymes that catalyze the
reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H)-dependent
oxido-reduction of carbonyl groups. Over 190 members have been identified in
species ranging from prokaryotes to plants, fungi, and animals. These proteins,
which are grouped into 16 families named AKR1-AKR16, have unique structural
features that influence their substrates and kinetics.
