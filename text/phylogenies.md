This dendrogram replaces the older version constructed in the GCG program and
was constructed using the multialign program which enables any user to conduct
their own pair-wise comparison. As a result of this enhancement, some families
have shifted. However, the nomenclature of the individual AKR families,
subfamilies and their members are essentially unchanged.

Note that tree diagrams are only available to families with at least three
members.
