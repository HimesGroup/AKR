This dendrogram replaces the older version constructed in the GCG program and
was constructed using the multialign program which enables any user to conduct
their own pair-wise comparison. As a result of this enhancement, some families
have shifted. However, the nomenclature of the individual AKR families,
subfamilies and their members are essentially unchanged.

For the AKR tree diagrams organized by family, note that while there are 16 AKR
families, lack of availability of sequences in Familyâ€™s 14-16 (as well as AKR8 &
AKR10) make it unfeasible to construct a phylogenetic tree for these families.
The Method Used to Create the Phylogenetic Trees, organized by AKR Family can be
