This page enables visualization of aligned protein sequences for various groups
of AKRs that are stored in our database. To use it, select a group of interest
from the interactive menu to adjust the set of sequences output. The alignment
is created with [MSAViewer](https://msa.biojs.net/), which provides an
interactive JavaScript-based visualization of multiple sequence alignment.
Options for the aligner can be set with the blue buttons, including the color
scheme. Further details can be found in the MSAViewer [user
manual](https://github.com/wilzbach/msa/wiki/User-manual) and this GitHub
repository on available [color
schemes](https://github.com/wilzbach/msa-colorschemes).
